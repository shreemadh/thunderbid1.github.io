    Royal Enfield is an Indian multinational motorcycle manufacturing company headquartered in Gurgaon. 
    The Royal Enfield brand, including its original English heritage, is the oldest global motorcycle brand in continuous production.
     The company operates manufacturing plants in Chennai in India.
     he first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901 by The Enfield Cycle Company of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, which was responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, 
     the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
     After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to
      patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job. 
      In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components.[7] By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.
